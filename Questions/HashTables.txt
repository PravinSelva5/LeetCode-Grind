A hash function takes a string of characters & maps it to a value of a certain length (hash/hash value)

-------------------
Good Hash function
-------------------
- easy to compute
- uniform distribution
- low collisions


- A collision is when a key maps to a spot that is already taken
    - A solution can be chaining, where each cell of the table points to a linked list
        - simple to implement, hash tables never get full, cache performance for chaining isn't good
        - mostly used when you don't know how many key slots will be needed

    - Open addressing, where if the hash index for a key is available, insert directly into the table.
        - if the index is taken, you will be probing until you find an empty index
        - open addressing requires more computation, hash tables can get full, open addressing provides better cache performance
        - mostly used when the frequency and number of keys is known
